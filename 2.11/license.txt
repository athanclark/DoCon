       Copyright (2007)  Serge Mechveliani.
       All rights reserved.
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Below we call  
  DoCon-derivative  any program close to DoCon-2.11 and derived from
                    DoCon-2.11
  User Program      any program incorporating or using 
                    DoCon-derivative.

This license states that

* no guarantees are provided on the good or bad consequences of using
  DoCon-2.11,
* permission is granted to everyone to redistribute and exploit  
  DoCon-2.11 or its parts, in source or binary form, modified or 
  not, and to use in publications the theoretical and technical 
  solutions described in DoCon-2.11 documentations and remarks,
  provided the following conditions are satisfied.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Redistribution of source code must retain as a whole this 
    license text.
(b) Redistribution in binary form must reproduce  as  a  whole  this 
    license in the documentation or in  materials  accompanying  the 
    distribution.
(c) Both the User Program and DoCon-derivative  should  be  given  a 
    name  different  from  DoCon,  if  it  does  not  coincide  with 
    DoCon-2.11.
(d) The  User Program  should contain at  the  upper  level  of  its 
    documentation materials
     a reference to DoCon-2.11, and
     a brief explanation of how the User Program relates to 
     DoCon-2.11 and how the DoCon-derivative  is obtained from 
     DoCon-2.11, so as to make clear the origin of the User Program.
(e) Mentioning or exploiting in a  publication  of any theoretical,
    or technical solution taken from  DoCon-2.11  manual or from its
    other remarks must be supplied with a reference to DoCon-2.11.
